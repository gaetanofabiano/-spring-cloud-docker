# Spring Boot "Microservice" Example Project

This is a sample Java / Maven / Spring Boot application that can be used as a starter for creating a microservice complete with built-in health check, metrics and much more. I hope it helps you. 
Don't care about syntax or code quality, beacause the purpose of this code is just to try some docker container feature.
